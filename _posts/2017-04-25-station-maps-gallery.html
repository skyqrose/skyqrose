    alt: A geographic map of Dudley Station, with building outlines. There are small circles with route numbers in them at each of the berths.

- title: A New MBTA Standard
  text: The MBTA has begun to standardize on this map style. I don’t like the style (having to remember a berth letter/number requires extra mental load, the lack of color makes the maps hard to navigate, and there’s too much irrelevant detail), but it’s more important that these maps are widespread and consistent than that they’re good. Right now I only know of these two examples. Please make more, MBTA!

    alt: A photo of a map on a brick wall. It's a detailed blueprint of the station, with large black and yellow letters for each berth. There's a list of which route stops at each berth.

  - desc: Alewife
    file: alewife.jpg
    alt: A photo of a map on the Alewife platform. It has an almost cartoonish train and an almost isometric drawing of the layout of the stairs and escalators. There's a disruption notice stickered on top.

  - desc: Emergency Training Center (under Broadway). This is my favorite station map in the MBTA system, and I'm disappointed it's not in a public station.
    file: emergency_training_center.jpg
    alt: A scale map of the emergency training center, with icons showing different training areas. The tunnels clearly used to be a loop of track for trains to turn around.

- title: Fire Annunciator Maps
  text: The most reliable place to find station maps is on the fire alarm annunciators. They're not really useful for navigation, but may be useful for future map-making, so I collect them.

I started my Dudley Station Map project because I couldn't find a station map.
I've since found a few, and I've started collecting them here.
I'll keep this list udpated as I find more.
If you find any that aren't here, please send them to me.
