# www.skyqrose.com

The source for my personal website. The build products are hosted by Github Pages over at skyqrose/skyqrose.github.io

Built with jekyll. To run locally,
* `bundle install`
* `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* visit `localhost:4000`

Because I use plugins, the site is built by Travis CI rather than Github. Commits pushed to master are automatically built by Travis and then pushed to the other repo, skyqrose/skyqrose.github.io
